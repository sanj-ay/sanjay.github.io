        <h1>Appetite for self-exploration</h1>
        <P class="intro" style="text-align:justify; font-size: 25px; line-height: 1.6;">I have plenty of plans going
            through my mind when I think about what can I do
            with this domain. I don't want to keep this domain as portfolio alone. It must be something self-rewarding.
            I have seen people who started blogging from their teenage. They have an advantage over others because they
            have something to look back. I don't even remember what I thought in previous years. The enemy of memory is
            not the time it is other memories. Blogging is like creating a trajectory to look back. I have a pretty much
            idea about how not to do it. Blogging has its legacy and authenticity apart from all other social networks
            because every person edits the story they tell about themselves, carefully ensuring what the world looks at
            whether it's over Instagram, Twitter or Facebook. Here it's uncertain. I can't expect any viewers. If I'm
            lucky, maybe I will get honest feedback. I think shared self-revelation is the best way to develop trust and
            cooperation around the planet. I want to share every thought, every book, every article I went through.
            Until now, I have never done anything with much consistency. I hope I can change that through this.

        </P>
