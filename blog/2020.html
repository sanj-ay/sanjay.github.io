        <h1>2020</h1>
        
           <p class="intro" style="text-align:justify; line-height: 1.4;"> When I look at a personal upfront, 2020 is one of the best years of mine. First 3 months were memorable because most of the time was with friends. We expected much more tea time together. I graduated this year( All credits go to the pandemic. All the final semester exams were conducted online and managed to pass . I never cleared any semester in a first attempt other than semester two ). Reason to have graduation is so that you can be free of it. I wrote 20+ university exams for the eight-semester degree(No More!).</p> 
            
            <p class="intro" style="text-align:justify; line-height: 1.4;">A year before I was more anxious than now. I couldn't find any peace from what I had. Now I live in a much more peaceful state. Honesty towards myself increased over this period.  It's important to figure out what you know and what don't know. Is that possible without honesty? I don't think so. Also, It's hard to offend an honest person(Give it a try).</p>
            
            <p class="intro" style="text-align:justify; line-height: 1.4;">  Never spend this much time in my home after joining college. The one good thing about working from home is that you don't have to check bank balance frequently. But a big chunk of money in the bank doesn't give what you want in life.  I don't have to pay any room rent only an emotional rent (It's huge). </p>
            
            <p class="intro" style="text-align:justify; line-height: 1.4;">Preparation phase of life is over. There are no more scheduled exams. I must be ready when I'm at the right time and right place.  I don't want to make any boring mistakes again. The new year does not make anything better If actions are inconsistent. Tomorrow can give you a heads-up after that you have to burn some fuel.</p>
