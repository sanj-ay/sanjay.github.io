        <h1>Appetite for self-exploration</h1>
        <p class="intro" style="text-align:justify; line-height: 1.4; ">There are plenty of plans going
            through my mind when I think about what can I do with this domain. I don't want to keep this domain as
            portfolio alone. It must be something self-rewarding. I have seen people who started blogging from their
            teenage. They have an advantage over others because they have something to look back. I don't even remember
            what I thought in previous years. The enemy of memory is not the time it is other memories. Blogging is like
            creating a trajectory to look back. I have a pretty much idea about how not to do it. Blogging has its
            legacy and authenticity apart from all other social networks because every person edits the story they tell
            about themselves, carefully ensuring what the world looks at whether it's over Instagram, Twitter or
            Facebook. Here it's uncertain. I can't expect any viewers. If I'm lucky, maybe I will get honest feedback.
            Shared self-revelation is the best way to develop trust and cooperation around the planet. I want to share
            every thought, every book, every article I went through. Until now, I have never done anything with much
            consistency. Hope it will change through this.</p>
